# HOUSICLE

The project is based on the domain web development (full stack). The project name is “Vehicle Rental System”. So basically, it is a website that helps the 
peripatetic to travel around and visit places without buying their own vehicle at a reasonable rate. This website is designed to help customers pick up 
bicycles, bikes, cars and buses to trip around.

This is a vehicle rental system website made for 4 modes of transport, namely
Bicycle, Bike, Car, Bus
   
### TECHNOLOGIES

It uses 
   1) `HTML`
   2) `CSS`
   3) `Bootstrap`
   4) `JavaScript`

to build the website, the backend was made with the help of `Php` and database used here is `MySQL`. 

This has one administrator account that verifies the subscriber and two types of user account. One of the vehicle dealers and one of the customers taking 
a rental vehicle. This application has only one administrator account and cannot have more than one administrator account.


We have improved this service by booking a vehicle (bicycle, bike, car or bus) for rent. In the current system all booking work is done by hand and it takes 
a lot of hard work to keep the details of bookings and vehicles. The purpose of the project is to carry out the work done on the vehicle rental management system 
such as producing daily bookings, vehicle (bicycle, bike, car or bus) records or route routes available, cost of renting all-way vehicle, keeping customer records. 

*This program helps you to store Customer information online. You can check your customer information at any time by using this app. The vehicle hire management 
system is a unique and innovative product. Using this you can also save details of the booking number for the current month or for the last six months.*
